# PPTP-seq
PPTP-seq (pooled promoter responses to transcription factor perturbations sequencing) is a highly scalable method to dissect regulatory genome. 
This repository includes data process scripts, processed data, external data, and jupyter notebooks used in the paper.

## Scripts
All the scripts were run on a HPC cluster. SLURM workload manager was used. It returns read counts of each sgRNA-promoter pair in each bin.
